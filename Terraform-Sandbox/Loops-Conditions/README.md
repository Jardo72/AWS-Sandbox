# Demonstration of Terraform Loops and Conditions
Simple demonstration of Terraform loops and conditions. For the sake of simplicity, this configuration only creates several IAM users. This configuration involves only single input variable with default value - it is used to demonstrate the for loop. Therefore, there is not `.tfvars` file. AWS region is also hard-coded in the [main.tf](./main.tf) file. In fact, the significance of the region is minimal for this configuration as IAM resources are global.
